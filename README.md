# DiskUsageCounter

A simple disk usage counter i wrote back in 2010 to show disk write stress realtime. I was curious if i buy an SSD when will it die. Maybe it can be useful for someone.
Currently I just added FormatKbSizeConverter for fancier value display. Thx to Thomas Freudenberg. https://thomasfreudenberg.com/archive/2017/01/21/presenting-byte-size-values-in-wpf/
